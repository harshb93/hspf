The old_code directory has some useful files in it for generating 
scenario data.  It was all moved to that directory as the point source 
method has changed as of this date.

All point source data are now supplied to the modeling side referenced 
by NPDES number.  The same point source data set is then used to make
wdms for both the watershed model and input to the water quality and 
hydrodynamic bay models.  Taking all three data sets out of a single
file reduces error in translation.
